            Hello and welcome to my virtual resume ! My name is Alicia Magro and
            I’m 29 years old. I am a former nurse who used to work in
            psychiatric wards for adults. After a few years of working as a
            psychiatric nurse, I have decided to begin a professional
            retraining.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Since I was very young, I have always been passionate about the
            digital field so it seemed only natural to me to choose one of these
            professions for my career change. After a skills assessment and a
            lot of thoughts, I stared to get very interested in web development.
            To confirm my choice, I was lucky enough to do an immersion
            internship for a week, at a company located in Euratechnologies in
            Lille. This internship, which I really enjoyed, allowed me to
            discover a whole new field that before that, was completely unknown
            to me. Afterward, I followed the BTech program with the Z
            association, which allowed me to confirm my great interest in web
            development. To do so, I am currently looking for a training to
            learn more about web development in order to make it my profession.
          </p>
